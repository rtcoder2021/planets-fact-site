  Venus

  <!-- Overview Content Start -->

  Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the
  Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the brightest natural object
  in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and
  can be, on rare occasions, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.

  <!-- Internal Structure Content Start -->

  The similarity in size and density between Venus and Earth suggests
  they share a similar internal structure: a core, mantle, and crust.
  Like that of Earth, Venusian core is most likely at least partially
  liquid because the two planets have been cooling at about the same rate.

  <!-- Surface Geology Content Start -->

  Much of the Venusian surface appears to have been shaped by volcanic activity.
  Venus has several times as many volcanoes as Earth, and it has 167 large
  volcanoes that are over 100 km (60 mi) across. The only volcanic complex
  of this size on Earth is the Big Island of Hawaii.
